# Ers_Project
This project’s purpose is to allow associates to develop features in a self-guided
environment. Completion of this project will finalize a working ERS application
before the foundations project presentation. The main goal is to build the
application into a working API that satisfies all the core functionality required.
Core MVP Features:

i. Must be able to log in with an email and password
• Ability to register a new account

function requirements. Here is the user story:

submission history. Employees will leverage this to see outstanding pending tickets
along with tickets that have been processed by managers. Here is the user story:

submissions.
i. Employees should be able to filter by status (pending, approved, or denied)
